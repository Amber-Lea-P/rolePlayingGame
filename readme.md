Notes:
Developers use HTML and CSS to control the content and styling of a page. And they use JavaScript to make that page interactive.

JavaScript is a powerful scripting language that you can use to make web pages interactive. It's one of the core technologies of the web, along with HTML and CSS. All modern browsers support JavaScript.

Project One: Role Playing Game will cover arrays, strings, objects, functions, loops, if/else statements, and more.
