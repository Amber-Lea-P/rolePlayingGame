Notes:
Developers use HTML and CSS to control the content and styling of a page. And they use JavaScript to make that page interactive.

JavaScript is a powerful scripting language that you can use to make web pages interactive. It's one of the core technologies of the web, along with HTML and CSS. All modern browsers support JavaScript.

Project One: Role Playing Game will cover arrays, strings, objects, functions, loops, if/else statements, and more. 

The logical OR operator: || 

The logical OR operator will use the first value if it is truthy â€“ that is, anything apart from NaN, null, undefined, 0, -0, 0n, "", and false. Otherwise, it will use the second value.

For example: num < 10 || num > 20.

After your numbers array, create a while loop. A while loop accepts a condition, and will run the code in the block until the condition is no longer true.

Your while loop should run while numbers.length is less than 10.

Here is an example of a while loop that runs while i is less than five.

while (i < 5) {

}


for loops are declared with three expressions separated by semicolons. for (a; b; c), where a is the initialization expression, b is the condition, and c is the final expression.

The initialization expression is executed only once, before the loop starts, and is often used to define and set up the loop variable. Think of it like declaring a counter to use in your loop.
The second statement in a for loop, the condition statement, is evaluated at the beginning of every loop iteration. The loop will continue as long as the condition evaluates to be true.

The last statement in a for loop, the final expression, is executed at the end of each loop iteration.
